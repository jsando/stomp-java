STOMP Library

Serious refactoring of Java Stomp client code from codehaus.  Original code has a lot of multithreading bugs
and doesn't appear to have been maintained in years.  Also a lot of non-Java code patterns makes it look like
a poor port from python or some other language.

Borrowed slightly from RabbitMQ AMQ client (which essentially follows the same pattern as the codehaus Stomp client).

Optimized for small footprint, multithreading safety, and runtime memory.

I'm mainly interested in high performance, low footprint messaging to ActiveMQ 5.3.  It may work with other stomp
servers, I don't know.

TODO:
 * [DONE] UDP send should actually send a MESSAGE command not a SEND, or when receiving transform it
 * UDP transmit should be able to reuse the same byte buffer, and cache SocketAddress for remote host (mostly should be same)
 * Need ability to pause/resume a connection
 * stomp+ssl url scheme
 * Unit tests
    * UDP loopback mode
    * TCP clean shutdown
    * UDP clean shutdown
    * UDP & TCP soTimeout
 * Perf tests
    * UDP performance (want to look at caching inetaddr)
    * Frame unmarshall performance without content-length
 * Should errors cause the connection to shutdown?  I commented this out, but I suspect it was a good idea, I just
   need better state management (ie, if already shutting down don't try to shutdown).
